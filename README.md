# Project Description

## NOTE I have stopped working on this project around 2012

Modular debugger for C/C++/D programming languages (and virtually anything else that supports Stabs/DWARF debug formats), Includes Gtkmm-based GUI, and Python scripting framework.

DWARF is supported via libdwarf (see https://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html).

Works on Intel and AMD (32 and 64-bit) processors. Support for PowerPC 32-bit is there but has not been tested in a quite a while.

Platforms such as ARM or Itanium are NOT supported at this time.

Debugging of stripped programs (and especially multi-threaded stripped executables) is not currently supported.

For my old contributions to libdwarf see: https://www.prevanders.net/dwarfolder.html#releases
